/**
 * What They Do: Sagas are like the workers behind the scenes. They handle tasks that take time, like fetching data from a server. They wait for actions to happen and then do the heavy lifting.
 * Example: If you fetch the list of employees from the server, a saga will do the job of getting that data.
